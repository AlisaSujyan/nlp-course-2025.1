two roads diverged in a yellow wood <END>
and sorry i could not travel both <END>
and be one traveler long i stood <END>
and looked down one as far as i could <END>
to where it bent in the undergrowth <END>
then took the other as just as fair <END>
and having perhaps the better claim <END>
because it was grassy and wanted wear <END>
though as for that the passing there <END>
had worn them really about the same <END>
and both that morning equally lay <END>
in leaves no step had trodden black <END>
oh i kept the first for another day <END>
yet knowing how way leads on to way <END>
i doubted if i should ever come back <END>
i shall be telling this with a sigh <END>
somewhere ages and ages hence <END>
two roads diverged in a wood and i <END>
i took the one less traveled by <END>
and that has made all the difference <END>
whose woods these are i think i know <END>
his house is in the village though <END>
he will not see me stopping here <END>
to watch his woods fill up with snow <END>
my little horse must think it queer <END>
to stop without a farmhouse near <END>
between the woods and frozen lake <END>
the darkest evening of the year <END>
he gives his harness bells a shake <END>
to ask if there is some mistake <END>
the only other sounds the sweep <END>
of easy wind and downy flake <END>
the woods are lovely dark and deep <END>
but i have promises to keep <END>
and miles to go before i sleep <END>
and miles to go before i sleep <END>
some say the world will end in fire <END>
some say in ice <END>
from what ive tasted of desire <END>
i hold with those who favor fire <END>
but if it had to perish twice <END>
i think i know enough of hate <END>
to say that for destruction ice <END>
is also great <END>
and would suffice <END>
natures first green is gold <END>
her hardest hue to hold <END>
her early leafs a flower <END>
but only so an hour <END>
then leaf subsides to leaf <END>
so eden sank to grief <END>
so dawn goes down to day <END>
nothing gold can stay <END>
i have been one acquainted with the night <END>
i have walked out in rain  and back in rain <END>
i have outwalked the furthest city light <END>
i have looked down the saddest city lane <END>
i have passed by the watchman on his beat <END>
and dropped my eyes unwilling to explain <END>
i have stood still and stopped the sound of feet <END>
when far away an interrupted cry <END>
came over houses from another street <END>
but not to call me back or say goodbye <END>
and further still at an unearthly height <END>
one luminary clock against the sky <END>
proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right <END>
i have been one acquainted with the night <END>
when i go up through the mowing field <END>
the headless aftermath <END>
smoothlaid like thatch with the heavy dew <END>
half closes the garden path <END>
and when i come to the garden ground <END>
the whir of sober birds <END>
up from the tangle of withered weeds <END>
is sadder than any words <END>
a tree beside the wall stands bare <END>
but a leaf that lingered brown <END>
disturbed i doubt not by my thought <END>
comes softly rattling down <END>
i end not far from my going forth <END>
by picking the faded blue <END>
of the last remaining aster flower <END>
to carry again to you <END>
a voice said look me in the stars <END>
and tell me truly men of earth <END>
if all the soulandbody scars <END>
were not too much to pay for birth <END>
to think to know the country and now know <END>
the hillside on the day the sun lets go <END>
ten million silver lizards out of snow <END>
as often as ive seen it done before <END>
i cant pretend to tell the way its done <END>
it looks as if some magic of the sun <END>
lifted the rug that bred them on the floor <END>
and the light breaking on them made them run <END>
but if i though to stop the wet stampede <END>
and caught one silver lizard by the tail <END>
and put my foot on one without avail <END>
and threw myself wetelbowed and wetkneed <END>
in front of twenty others wriggling speed <END>
in the confusion of them all aglitter <END>
and birds that joined in the excited fun <END>
by doubling and redoubling song and twitter <END>
i have no doubt id end by holding none <END>
it takes the moon for this the suns a wizard <END>
by all i tell but sos the moon a witch <END>
from the high west she makes a gentle cast <END>
and suddenly without a jerk or twitch <END>
she has her speel on every single lizard <END>
i fancied when i looked at six oclock <END>
the swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast <END>
the moon was waiting for her chill effect <END>
i looked at nine the swarm was turned to rock <END>
in every lifelike posture of the swarm <END>
transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect <END>
across each other and side by side they lay <END>
the spell that so could hold them as they were <END>
was wrought through trees without a breath of storm <END>
to make a leaf if there had been one stir <END>
one lizard at the end of every ray <END>
the thought of my attempting such a stray <END>
once on the kind of day called weather breeder <END>
when the heat slowly hazes and the sun <END>
by its own power seems to be undone <END>
i was half boring through half climbing through <END>
a swamp of cedar choked with oil of cedar <END>
and scurf of plants and weary and overheated <END>
and sorry i ever left the road i knew <END>
i paused and rested on a sort of hook <END>
that had me by the coat as good as seated <END>
and since there was no other way to look <END>
looked up toward heaven and there against the blue <END>
stood over me a resurrected tree <END>
a tree that had been down and raised again‚êî <END>
a barkless spectre he had halted too <END>
as if for fear of treading upon me <END>
i saw the strange position of his hands‚êî <END>
up at his shoulders dragging yellow strands <END>
of wire with something in it from men to men <END>
you here i said where arent you nowadays <END>
and whats the news you carry‚êîif you know <END>
and tell me where youre off for‚êîmontreal <END>
me im not off for anywhere at all <END>
sometimes i wander out of beaten ways <END>
half looking for the orchid calypso <END>
brown lived at such a lofty farm <END>
that everyone for miles could see <END>
his lantern when he did his chores <END>
in winter after halfpast three <END>
and many must have seen him make <END>
his wild descent from there one night <END>
cross lots cross walls cross everything <END>
describing rings of lantern light <END>
between the house and barn the gale <END>
got him by something he had on <END>
and blew him out on the icy crust <END>
that cased the world and he was gone <END>
walls were all buried trees were few <END>
he saw no stay unless he stove <END>
a hole in somewhere with his heel <END>
but though repeatedly he strove <END>
and stamped and said things to himself <END>
and sometimes something seemed to yield <END>
he gained no foothold but pursued <END>
his journey down from field to field <END>
sometimes he came with arms outspread <END>
like wings revolving in the scene <END>
upon his longer axis and <END>
with no small dignity of mien <END>
faster or slower as he chanced <END>
sitting or standing as he chose <END>
according as he feared to risk <END>
his neck or thought to spare his clothes <END>
he never let the lantern drop <END>
and some exclaimed who saw afar <END>
the figures he described with it <END>
i wonder what those signals are <END>
brown makes at such an hour of night <END>
hes celebrating something strange <END>
i wonder if hes sold his farm <END>
or been made master of the grange <END>
he reeled he lurched he bobbed he checked <END>
he fell and made the lantern rattle <END>
but saved the light from going out <END>
so halfway down he fought the battle <END>
incredulous of his own bad luck <END>
and then becoming reconciled <END>
to everything he gave it up <END>
and came down like a coasting child <END>
well‚êîi‚êîbe‚êî that was all he said <END>
as standing in the river road <END>
he looked back up the slippery slope <END>
two miles it was to his abode <END>
sometimes as an authority <END>
on motorcars im asked if i <END>
should say our stock was petered out <END>
and this is my sincere reply <END>
yankees are what they always were <END>
dont think brown ever gave up hope <END>
of getting home again because <END>
he couldnt climb that slippery slope <END>
or even thought of standing there <END>
until the january thaw <END>
should take the polish off the crust <END>
he bowed with grace to natural law <END>
and then went round it on his feet <END>
after the manner of our stock <END>
not much concerned for those to whom <END>
at that particular time oclock <END>
it must have looked as if the course <END>
he steered was really straight away <END>
from that which he was headed for‚êî <END>
not much concerned for them i say <END>
no more so than became a man‚êî <END>
and politician at odd seasons <END>
ive kept brown standing in the cold <END>
while i invested him with reasons <END>
but now he snapped his eyes three times <END>
then shook his lantern saying iles <END>
bout out and took the long way home <END>
by road a matter of several miles <END>
now that theyve got it settled whose i be <END>
im going to tell them something they wont like <END>
theyve got it settled wrong and i can prove it <END>
flattered i must be to have two towns fighting <END>
to make a present of me to each other <END>
they dont dispose me either one of them <END>
to spare them any trouble double troubles <END>
always the witchs motto anyway <END>
ill double theirs for both of them you watch me <END>
theyll find theyve got the whole thing to do over <END>
that is if facts is what they want to go by <END>
they set a lot now dont they by a record <END>
of arthur amys having once been up <END>
for hog reeve in march meeting here in warren <END>
i could have told them any time this twelvemonth <END>
the arthur amy i was married to <END>
couldnt have been the one they say was up <END>
in warren at march meeting for the reason <END>
he want but fifteen at the time they say <END>
the arthur amy i was married to <END>
voted the only times he ever voted <END>
which wasnt many in the town of wentworth <END>
one of the times was when twas in the warrant <END>
to see if the town wanted to take over <END>
the tote road to our clearing where we lived <END>
ill tell you whod remember heman lapish <END>
their arthur amy was the father of mine <END>
so now theyve dragged it through the law courts once <END>
i guess theyd better drag it through again <END>
wentworth and warrens both good towns to live in <END>
only i happen to prefer to live <END>
in wentworth from now on and when alls said <END>
rights right and the temptation to do right <END>
when i can hurt someone by doing it <END>
has always been too much for me it has <END>
i know of some folks thatd be set up <END>
at having in their town a noted witch <END>
but most would have to think of the expense <END>
that even i would be they ought to know <END>
that as a witch id often milk a bat <END>
and thatd be enough to last for days <END>
itd make my position stronger i think <END>
if i was to consent to give some sign <END>
to make it surer that i was a witch <END>
it want no sign i spose when mallice huse <END>
said that i took him out in his old age <END>
and rode all over everything on him <END>
until id had him worn to skin and bones <END>
and if id left him hitched unblanketed <END>
in front of one town hall id left him hitched <END>
in front of every one in grafton county <END>
some cried shame on me not to blanket him <END>
the poor old man it would have been all right <END>
if some one hadnt said to gnaw the posts <END>
he stood beside and leave his trade mark on them <END>
so they could recognize them not a post <END>
that they could hear tell of was scarified <END>
they made him keep on gnawing till he whined <END>
then that same smarty someone said to look <END>
hed bet huse was a cribber and had gnawed <END>
the crib he slept in and as sures youre born <END>
they found hed gnawed the four posts of his bed <END>
all four of them to splinters what did that prove <END>
not that he hadnt gnawed the hitching posts <END>
he said he had besides because a horse <END>
gnaws in the stable aint no proof to me <END>
he dont gnaw trees and posts and fences too <END>
but everybody took it for proof <END>
i was a strapping girl of twenty then <END>
the smarty someone who spoiled everything <END>
was arthur amy you know who he was <END>
that was the way he started courting me <END>
he never said much after we were married <END>
but i mistrusted he was none too proud <END>
of having interfered in the huse business <END>
i guess he found he got more out of me <END>
by having me a witch or something happened <END>
to turn him round he got to saying things <END>
to undo what hed done and make it right <END>
like no she aint come back from kiting yet <END>
last night was one of her nights out shes kiting <END>
she thinks when the wind makes a night of it <END>
she might as well herself but he liked best <END>
to let on he was plagued to death with me <END>
if anyone had seen me coming home <END>
over the ridgepole stride of a broomstick <END>
as often as he had in the tail of the night <END>
he guessed theyd know what he had to put up with <END>
well i showed arthur amy signs enough <END>
off from the house as far as we could keep <END>
and from barn smells you cant wash out of ploughed ground <END>
with all the rain and snow of seven years <END>
and i dont mean just skulls of rogers rangers <END>
on moosilauke but woman signs to man <END>
only bewitched so i would last him longer <END>
up where the trees grow short the mosses tall <END>
i made him gather me wet snow berries <END>
on slippery rocks beside a waterfall <END>
i made him do it for me in the dark <END>
and he liked everything i made him do <END>
i hope if he is where he sees me now <END>
hes so far off he cant see what ive come to <END>
you _can_ come down from everything to nothing <END>
all is if id aknown when i was young <END>
and full of it that this would be the end <END>
it doesnt seem as if id had the courage <END>
to make so free and kick up in folks faces <END>
i might have but it doesnt seem as if <END>
old davis owned a solid mica mountain <END>
in dalton that would someday make his fortune <END>
thered been some boston people out to see it <END>
and experts said that deep down in the mountain <END>
the mica sheets were big as plateglass windows <END>
hed like to take me there and show it to me <END>
ill tell you what you show me you remember <END>
you said you knew the place where once on kinsman <END>
the early mormons made a settlement <END>
and built a stone baptismal font outdoors <END>
but smith or someone called them off the mountain <END>
to go west to a worse fight with the desert <END>
you said youd seen the stone baptismal font <END>
well take me there <END>
someday i will <END>
today <END>
huh that old bathtub what is that to see <END>
lets talk about it <END>
lets go see the place <END>
to shut you up ill tell you what ill do <END>
ill find that fountain if it takes all summer <END>
and both of our united strengths to do it <END>
youve lost it then <END>
not so but i can find it <END>
no doubt its grown up some to woods around it <END>
the mountain may have shifted since i saw it <END>
in eightyfive <END>
as long ago as that <END>
if i remember rightly it had sprung <END>
a leak and emptied then and forty years <END>
can do a good deal to bad masonry <END>
you wont see any mormon swimming in it <END>
but you have said it and were off to find it <END>
old as i am im going to let myself <END>
be dragged by you all over everywhere  <END>
i thought you were a guide <END>
i am a guide <END>
and thats why i cant decently refuse you <END>
we made a day of it out of the world <END>
ascending to descend to reascend <END>
the old man seriously took his bearings <END>
and spoke his doubts in every open place <END>
we came out on a lookoff where we faced <END>
a cliff and on the cliff a bottle painted <END>
or stained by vegetation from above <END>
a likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist <END>
well if i havent brought you to the fountain <END>
at least ive brought you to the famous bottle <END>
i wont accept the substitute its empty <END>
sos everything <END>
i want my fountain <END>
i guess youd find the fountain just as empty <END>
and anyway this tells me where i am <END>
hadnt you long suspected where you were <END>
you mean miles from that mormon settlement <END>
look here you treat your guide with due respect <END>
if you dont want to spend the night outdoors <END>
i vow we must be near the place from where <END>
the two converging slides the avalanches <END>
on marshall look like donkeys ears <END>
we may as well see that and save the day <END>
dont donkeys ears suggest we shake our own <END>
for gods sake arent you fond of viewing nature <END>
you dont like nature all you like is books <END>
what signify a donkeys cars and bottle <END>
however natural give you your books <END>
well then right here is where i show you books <END>
come straight down off this mountain just as fast <END>
as we can fall and keep abouncing on our feet <END>
its hell for knees unless done hellforleather <END>
be ready i thought for almost anything <END>
we struck a road i didnt recognize <END>
but welcomed for the chance to lave my shoes <END>
in dust once more we followed this a mile <END>
perhaps to where it ended at a house <END>
i didnt know was there it was the kind <END>
to bring me to for broadboard paneling <END>
i never saw so good a house deserted <END>
excuse me if i ask you in a window <END>
that happens to be broken davis said <END>
the outside doors as yet have held against us <END>
i want to introduce you to the people <END>
who used to live here they were robinsons <END>
you must have heard of clara robinson <END>
the poetess who wrote the book of verses <END>
and had it published it was all about <END>
the posies on her inner windowsill <END>
and the birds on her outer windowsill <END>
and how she tended both or had them tended <END>
she never tended anything herself <END>
she was shut in for life she lived her whole <END>
life long in bed and wrote her things in bed <END>
ill show you how she had her sills extended <END>
to entertain the birds and hold the flowers <END>
our business firsts up attic with her books <END>
we trod uncomfortably on crunching glass <END>
through a house stripped of everything <END>
except it seemed the poetesss poems <END>
books i should say if books are what is needed <END>
a whole edition in a packing case <END>
that overflowing like a horn of plenty <END>
or like the poetesss heart of love <END>
had spilled them near the window toward the light <END>
where driven rain had wet and swollen them <END>
enough to stock a village library <END>
unfortunately all of one kind though <END>
they bad been brought home from some publisher <END>
and taken thus into the family <END>
boys and bad hunters had known what to do <END>
with stone and lead to unprotected glass <END>
shatter it inward on the unswept floors <END>
how had the tender verse escaped their outrage <END>
by being invisible for what it was <END>
or else by some remoteness that defied them <END>
to find out what to do to hurt a poem <END>
yet oh the tempting flatness of a book <END>
to send it sailing out the attic window <END>
till it caught wind and opening out its covers <END>
tried to improve on sailing like a tile <END>
by flying like a bird silent in flight <END>
but all the burden of its body song <END>
only to tumble like a stricken bird <END>
and lie in stones and bushes unretrieved <END>
books were not thrown irreverently about <END>
they simply lay where someone now and then <END>
having tried one had dropped it at his feet <END>
and left it lying where it fell rejected <END>
here were all those the poetesss life <END>
had been too short to sell or give away <END>
take one old davis bade me graciously <END>
why not take two or three <END>
take all you want <END>
goodlooking books like that he picked one fresh <END>
in virgin wrapper from deep in the box <END>
and stroked it with a hornyhanded kindness <END>
he read in one and i read in another <END>
both either looking for or finding something <END>
the attic wasps went missing by like bullets <END>
i was soon satisfied for the time being <END>
all the way home i kept remembering <END>
the small book in my pocket it was there <END>
the poetess had sighed i knew in heaven <END>
at having eased her heart of one more copy <END>
legitimately my demand upon her <END>
though slight was a demand she felt the tug <END>
in time she would be rid of all her books <END>
i stay <END>
but it isnt as if <END>
there wasnt always hudsons bay <END>
and the fur trade <END>
a small skiff <END>
and a paddle blade <END>
i can just see my tent pegged <END>
and me on the floor <END>
crosslegged <END>
and a trapper looking in at the door <END>
with furs to sell <END>
his names joe <END>
alias john <END>
and between what he doesnt know <END>
and wont tell <END>
about where henry hudsons gone <END>
i cant say hes much help <END>
but we get on <END>
the seal yelp <END>
on an ice cake <END>
its not men by some mistake <END>
no <END>
theres not a soul <END>
for a windbreak <END>
between me and the north pole‚êî <END>
except always johnjoe <END>
my french indian esquimaux <END>
and hes off setting traps <END>
in one himself perhaps <END>
give a headshake <END>
over so much bay <END>
thrown away <END>
in snow and mist <END>
that doesnt exist <END>
i was going to say <END>
for god man or beasts sake <END>
yet does perhaps for all three <END>
dont ask joe <END>
what it is to him <END>
its sometimes dim <END>
what it is to me <END>
unless it be <END>
its the old captains dark fate <END>
who failed to find or force a strait <END>
in its twothousandmile coast <END>
and his crew left him where be failed <END>
and nothing came of all be sailed <END>
its to say you and i‚êî <END>
to such a ghost‚êî <END>
you and i <END>
off here <END>
with the dead race of the great auk <END>
and better defeat almost <END>
if seen clear <END>
than lifes victories of doubt <END>
that need endless talktalk <END>
to make them out <END>
i staid the night for shelter at a farm <END>
behind the mountains with a mother and son <END>
two oldbelievers they did all the talking <END>
mother folks think a witch who has familiar spirits <END>
she could call up to pass a winter evening <END>
but wont should be burned at the stake or something <END>
summoning spirits isnt button button <END>
whos got the button i would have them know <END>
son mother can make a common table rear <END>
and kick with two legs like an army mule <END>
mother and when ive done it what good have i <END>
done <END>
rather than tip a table for you let me <END>
tell you what ralle the sioux control once told me <END>
he said the dead had souls but when i asked him <END>
how could that be  i thought the dead were souls <END>
he broke my trance dont that make you suspicious <END>
that theres something the dead are keeping back <END>
yes theres something the dead are keeping back <END>
son you wouldnt want to tell him what we have <END>
up attic mother <END>
mother bones  a skeleton <END>
son but the headboard of mothers bed is pushed <END>
against the attic door the door is nailed <END>
its harmless mother hears it in the night <END>
halting perplexed behind the barrier <END>
of door and headboard where it wants to get <END>
is back into the cellar where it came from <END>
mother well never let them will we son well <END>
never  <END>
son it left the cellar forty years ago <END>
and carried itself like a pile of dishes <END>
up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen <END>
another from the kitchen to the bedroom <END>
another from the bedroom to the attic <END>
right past both father and mother and neither stopped <END>
it <END>
father had gone upstairs mother was downstairs <END>
i was a baby i dont know where i was <END>
mother the only fault my husband found with me  <END>
i went to sleep before i went to bed <END>
especially in winter when the bed <END>
might just as well be ice and the clothes snow <END>
the night the bones came up the cellarstairs <END>
toffile had gone to bed alone and left me <END>
but left an open door to cool the room off <END>
so as to sort of turn me out of it <END>
i was just coming to myself enough <END>
to wonder where the cold was coming from <END>
when i heard toffile upstairs in the bedroom <END>
and thought i heard him downstairs in the cellar <END>
the board we had laid down to walk dryshod on <END>
when there was water in the cellar in spring <END>
struck the hard cellar bottom and then someone <END>
began the stairs two footsteps for each step <END>
the way a man with one leg and a crutch <END>
or a little child comes up it wasnt toffile <END>
it wasnt anyone who could be there <END>
the bulkhead doubledoors were doublelocked <END>
and swollen tight and buried under snow <END>
the cellar windows were banked up with sawdust <END>
and swollen tight and buried under snow <END>
it was the bones i knew them  and good reason <END>
my first impulse was to get to the knob <END>
and hold the door but the bones didnt try <END>
the door they halted helpless on the landing <END>
waiting for things to happen in their favour <END>
the faintest restless rustling ran all through them <END>
i never could have done the thing i did <END>
if the wish hadnt been too strong in me <END>
to see how they were mounted for this walk <END>
i had a vision of them put together <END>
not like a man but like a chandelier <END>
so suddenly i flung the door wide on him <END>
a moment he stood balancing with emotion <END>
and all but lost himself a tongue of fire <END>
flashed out and licked along his upper teeth <END>
smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes <END>
then he came at me with one hand outstretched <END>
the way he did in life once but this time <END>
i struck the hand off brittle on the floor <END>
and fell back from him on the floor myself <END>
the fingerpieces slid in all directions <END>
where did i see one of those pieces lately <END>
hand me my buttonbox it must be there <END>
i sat up on the floor and shouted toffile <END>
its coming up to you it had its choice <END>
of the door to the cellar or the hall <END>
it took the hall door for the novelty <END>
and set off briskly for so slow a thing <END>
stillgoing every which way in the joints though <END>
so that it looked like lightning or a scribble <END>
from the slap i had just now given its hand <END>
i listened till it almost climbed the stairs <END>
from the hall to the only finished bedroom <END>
before i got up to do anything <END>
then ran and shouted shut the bedroom door <END>
toffile for my sake company he said <END>
dont make me get up im too warm in bed <END>
so lying forward weakly on the handrail <END>
i pushed myself upstairs and in the light <END>
the kitchen had been dark i had to own <END>
i could see nothing toffile i dont see it <END>
its with us in the room though its the bones <END>
what bones the cellar bones out of the grave <END>
that made him throw his bare legs out of bed <END>
and sit up by me and take hold of me <END>
i wanted to put out the light and see <END>
if i could see it or else mow the room <END>
with our arms at the level of our knees <END>
and bring the chalkpile down ill tell you what <END>
its looking for another door to try <END>
the uncommonly deep snow has made him think <END>
of his old song the wild colonial boy <END>
he always used to sing along the toteroad <END>
hes after an open door to get outdoors <END>
lets trap him with an open door up attic <END>
toffile agreed to that and sure enough <END>
almost the moment he was given an opening <END>
the steps began to climb the attic stairs <END>
i heard them toffile didnt seem to hear them <END>
quick  i slammed to the door and held the knob <END>
toffile get nails i made him nail the door shut <END>
and push the headboard of the bed against it <END>
then we asked was there anything <END>
up attic that wed ever want again <END>
the attic was less to us than the cellar <END>
if the bones liked the attic let them have it <END>
let them stay in the attic when they sometimes <END>
come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed <END>
behind the door and headboard of the bed <END>
brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers <END>
with sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter <END>
thats what i sit up in the dark to say <END>
to no one any more since toffile died <END>
2o3 let them stay in the attic since they went there <END>
i promised toffile to be cruel to them <END>
for helping them be cruel once to him <END>
son we think they had a grave down in the cellar <END>
mother we know they had a grave down in the cellar <END>
son we never could find out whose bones they were <END>
mother yes we could too son tell the truth for once <END>
they were a mans his father killed for me <END>
i mean a man he killed instead of me <END>
the least i could do was to help dig their grave <END>
we were about it one night in the cellar <END>
son knows the story but twas not for him <END>
to tell the truth suppose the time had come <END>
son looks surprised to see me end a lie <END>
wed kept all these years between ourselves <END>
so as to have it ready for outsiders <END>
but tonight i dont care enough to lie <END>
i dont remember why i ever cared <END>
toffile if he were here i dont believe <END>
could tell you why he ever cared himself <END>
she hadnt found the fingerbone she wanted <END>
among the buttons poured out in her lap <END>
i verified the name next morning toffile <END>
the rural letterbox said toffile lajway <END>
the west was getting out of gold <END>
the breath of air had died of cold <END>
when shoeing home across the white <END>
i thought i saw a bird alight <END>
in summer when i passed the place <END>
i had to stop and lift my face <END>
a bird with an angelic gift <END>
was singing in it sweet and swift <END>
no bird was singing in it now <END>
a single leaf was on a bough <END>
and that was all there was to see <END>
in going twice around the tree <END>
from my advantage on a hill <END>
i judged that such a crystal chill <END>
was only adding frost to snow <END>
as gilt to gold that wouldnt show <END>
a brush had left a crooked stroke <END>
of what was either cloud or smoke <END>
from north to south across the blue <END>
a piercing little star was through <END>
a governor it was proclaimed this time <END>
when all who would come seeking in new hampshire <END>
ancestral memories might come together <END>
and those of the name stark gathered in bow <END>
a rockstrewn town where farming has fallen off <END>
and sproutlands flourish where the axe has gone <END>
someone had literally run to earth <END>
in an old cellar hole in a byroad <END>
the origin of all the family there <END>
thence they were sprung so numerous a tribe <END>
that now not all the houses left in town <END>
made shift to shelter them without the help <END>
of here and there a tent in grove and orchard <END>
they were at bow but that was not enough <END>
nothing would do but they must fix a day <END>
to stand together on the craters verge <END>
that turned them on the world and try to fathom <END>
the past and get some strangeness out of it <END>
but rain spoiled all the day began uncertain <END>
with clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted <END>
the young folk held some hope out to each other <END>
till well toward noon when the storm settled down <END>
with a swish in the grass what if the others <END>
are there they said it isnt going to rain <END>
only one from a farm not far away <END>
strolled thither not expecting he would find <END>
anyone else but out of idleness <END>
one and one other yes for there were two <END>
the second round the curving hillside road <END>
was a girl and she halted some way off <END>
to reconnoitre and then made up her mind <END>
at least to pass by and see who he was <END>
and perhaps hear some word about the weather <END>
this was some stark she didnt know he nodded <END>
no f„∫te today he said <END>
it looks that way <END>
she swept the heavens turning on her heel <END>
i only idled down <END>
i idled down <END>
provision there had been for just such meeting <END>
of stranger cousins in a family tree <END>
drawn on a sort of passport with the branch <END>
of the one bearing it done in detail <END>
some zealous ones laborious device <END>
she made a sudden movement toward her bodice <END>
as one who clasps her heart they laughed together <END>
stark he inquired no matter for the proof <END>
yes stark and you <END>
im stark he drew his passport <END>
you know we might not be and still be cousins <END>
the town is full of chases lowes and baileys <END>
all claiming some priority in starkness <END>
my mother was a lane yet might have married <END>
anyone upon earth and still her children <END>
would have been starks and doubtless here today <END>
you riddle with your genealogy <END>
like a viola i dont follow you <END>
i only mean my mother was a stark <END>
several times over and by marrying father <END>
no more than brought us back into the name <END>
one ought not to be thrown into confusion <END>
by a plain statement of relationship <END>
but i own what you say makes my head spin <END>
you take my card you seem so good at such things <END>
and see if you can reckon our cousinship <END>
why not take seats here on the cellar wall <END>
and dangle feet among the raspberry vines <END>
under the shelter of the family tree <END>
just so that ought to be enough protection <END>
not from the rain i think its going to rain <END>
its raining <END>
no its misting lets be fair <END>
does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes <END>
the situation was like this the road <END>
bowed outward on the mountain halfway up <END>
and disappeared and ended not far off <END>
no one went home that way the only house <END>
beyond where they were was a shattered seedpod <END>
and below roared a brook hidden in trees <END>
the sound of which was silence for the place <END>
this he sat listening to till she gave judgment <END>
on fathers side it seems were let me see   <END>
dont be too technical you have three cards <END>
four cards one yours three mine one for each branch <END>
of the stark family im a member of <END>
dyou know a person so related to herself <END>
is supposed to be mad <END>
i may be mad <END>
you look so sitting out here in the rain <END>
studying genealogy with me <END>
you never saw before what will we come to <END>
with all this pride of ancestry we yankees <END>
i think were all mad tell me why were here <END>
drawn into town about this cellar hole <END>
like wild geese on a lake before a storm <END>
what do we see in such a hole i wonder <END>
the indians had a myth of chicamoztoc <END>
which means the seven caves that we came out of <END>
this is the pit from which we starks were digged <END>
you must be learned thats what you see in it <END>
and what do you see <END>
yes what do i see <END>
first let me look i see raspberry vines   <END>
oh if youre going to use your eyes just hear <END>
what i see its a little little boy <END>
as pale and dim as a match flame in the sun <END>
hes groping in the cellar after jam <END>
he thinks its dark and its flooded with daylight <END>
hes nothing listen when i lean like this <END>
i can make out old grandsir stark distinctly <END>
with his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug <END>
bless you it isnt grandsir stark its granny <END>
but the pipes there and smoking and the jug <END>
shes after cider the old girl shes thirsty <END>
heres hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely <END>
tell me about her does she look like me <END>
she should shouldnt she youre so many times <END>
over descended from her i believe <END>
she does look like you stay the way you are <END>
the nose is just the same and sos the chin <END>
making allowance making due allowance <END>
you poor dear great great great great granny <END>
see that you get her greatness right dont stint her <END>
yes its important though you think it isnt <END>
i wont be teased but see how wet i am <END>
yes you must go we cant stay here for ever <END>
but wait until i give you a hand up <END>
a bead of silver water more or less <END>
strung on your hair wont hurt your summer looks <END>
i wanted to try something with the noise <END>
that the brook raises in the empty valley <END>
we have seen visions now consult the voices <END>
something i must have learned riding in trains <END>
when i was young i used the roar <END>
to set the voices speaking out of it <END>
speaking or singing and the bandmusic playing <END>
perhaps you have the art of what i mean <END>
ive never listened in among the sounds <END>
that a brook makes in such a wild descent <END>
it ought to give a purer oracle <END>
its as you throw a picture on a screen <END>
the meaning of it all is out of you <END>
the voices give you what you wish to hear <END>
strangely its anything they wish to give <END>
then i dont know it must be strange enough <END>
i wonder if its not your makebelieve <END>
what do you think youre like to hear today <END>
from the sense of our having been together <END>
but why take time for what im like to hear <END>
ill tell you what the voices really say <END>
you will do very well right where you are <END>
a little longer i mustnt feel too hurried <END>
or i cant give myself to hear the voices <END>
is this some trance you are withdrawing into <END>
you must be very still you mustnt talk <END>
ill hardly breathe <END>
the voices seem to say   <END>
im waiting <END>
dont the voices seem to say <END>
call her nausicaa the unafraid <END>
of an acquaintance made adventurously <END>
i let you say that on consideration <END>
i dont see very well how you can help it <END>
you want the truth i speak but by the voices <END>
you see they know i havent had your name <END>
though what a name should matter between us   <END>
i shall suspect   <END>
be good the voices say <END>
call her nausicaa and take a timber <END>
that you shall find lies in the cellar charred <END>
among the raspberries and hew and shape it <END>
for a doorsill or other corner piece <END>
in a new cottage on the ancient spot <END>
the life is not yet all gone out of it <END>
and come and make your summer dwelling here <END>
and perhaps she will come still unafraid <END>
and sit before you in the open door <END>
with flowers in her lap until they fade <END>
but not come in across the sacred sill   <END>
i wonder where your oracle is tending <END>
you can see that theres something wrong with it <END>
or it would speak in dialect whose voice <END>
does it purport to speak in not old grandsirs <END>
nor grannys surely call up one of them <END>
they have best right to be heard in this place <END>
you seem so partial to our greatgrandmother <END>
nine times removed correct me if i err <END>
you will be likely to regard as sacred <END>
anything she may say but let me warn you <END>
folks in her day were given to plain speaking <END>
you think youd best tempt her at such a time <END>
it rests with us always to cut her off <END>
well then its granny speaking i dunnow <END>
mebbe im wrong to take it as i do <END>
there aint no names quite like the old ones though <END>
nor never will be to my way of thinking <END>
one mustnt bear too hard on the new comers <END>
but theres a dite too many of them for comfort <END>
i should feel easier if i could see <END>
more of the salt wherewith theyre to be salted <END>
son you do as youre told you take the timber <END>
its as sound as the day when it was cut <END>
and begin over   there shed better stop <END>
you can see what is troubling granny though <END>
but dont you think we sometimes make too much <END>
of the old stock what counts is the ideals <END>
and those will bear some keeping still about <END>
i can see we are going to be good friends <END>
i like your going to be you said just now <END>
its going to rain <END>
i know and it was raining <END>
i let you say all that but i must go now <END>
you let me say it on consideration <END>
how shall we say goodbye in such a case <END>
how shall we <END>
will you leave the way to me <END>
no i dont trust your eyes youve said enough <END>
now give me your hand up pick me that flower <END>
where shall we meet again <END>
nowhere but here <END>
once more before we meet elsewhere <END>
in rain <END>
it ought to be in rain sometime in rain <END>
in rain tomorrow shall we if it rains <END>
but if we must in sunshine so she went <END>
builder in building the little house <END>
in every way you may please yourself <END>
but please please me in the kitchen chimney <END>
dont build me a chimney upon a shelf <END>
however far you must go for bricks <END>
whatever they cost apiece or a pound <END>
but me enough for a fulllength chimney <END>
and build the chimney clear from the ground <END>
its not that im greatly afraid of fire <END>
but i never heard of a house that throve <END>
and i know of one that didnt thrive <END>
where the chimney started above the stove <END>
and i dread the ominous stain of tar <END>
that there always is on the papered walls <END>
and the smell of fire drowned in rain <END>
that there always is when the chimneys false <END>
a shelfs for a clock or vase or picture <END>
but i dont see why it should have to bear <END>
a chimney that only would serve to remind me <END>
of castles i used to build in air <END>
i had for my winter evening walk <END>
no one at all with whom to talk <END>
but i had the cottages in a row <END>
up to their shining eyes in snow <END>
and i thought i had the folk within <END>
i had the sound of a violin <END>
i had a glimpse through curtain laces <END>
of youthful forms and youthful faces <END>
i had such company outward bound <END>
i went till there were no cottages found <END>
i turned and repented but coming back <END>
i saw no window but that was black <END>
over the snow my creaking feet <END>
disturbed the slumbering village street <END>
like profanation by your leave <END>
at ten oclock of a winter eve <END>
inscription for a garden wall <END>
winds blow the open grassy places bleak <END>
but where this old wall burns a sunny cheek <END>
they eddy over it too toppling weak <END>
to blow the earth or anything selfclear <END>
moisture and color and odor thicken here <END>
the hours of daylight gather atmosphere <END>
to ridgely torrence <END>
on last looking into his hesperides <END>
i often see flowers from a passing car <END>
that are gone before i can tell what they are <END>
i want to get out of the train and go back <END>
to see what they were beside the track <END>
i name all the flowers i am sure they werent <END>
not fireweed loving where woods have burnt <END>
not bluebells gracing a tunnel mouth <END>
not lupine living on sand and drouth <END>
was something brushed across my mind <END>
that no one on earth will ever find <END>
heaven gives it glimpses only to those <END>
not in position to look too close <END>
back out of all this now too much for us <END>
back in a time made simple by the loss <END>
of detail burned dissolved and broken off <END>
like graveyard marble sculpture in the weather <END>
there is a house that is no more a house <END>
upon a farm that is no more a farm <END>
and in a town that is no more a town <END>
the road there if youll let a guide direct you <END>
who only has at heart your getting lost <END>
may seem as if it should have been a quarry  <END>
great monolithic knees the former town <END>
long since gave up pretense of keeping covered <END>
and theres a story in a book about it <END>
besides the wear of iron wagon wheels <END>
the ledges show lines ruled southeastnorthwest <END>
the chisel work of an enormous glacier <END>
that braced his feet against the arctic pole <END>
you must not mind a certain coolness from him <END>
still said to haunt this side of panther mountain <END>
nor need you mind the serial ordeal <END>
of being watched from forty cellar holes <END>
as if by eye pairs out of forty firkins <END>
as for the woods excitement over you <END>
that sends light rustle rushes to their leaves <END>
charge that to upstart inexperience <END>
where were they all not twenty years ago <END>
they think too much of having shaded out <END>
a few old peckerfretted apple trees <END>
make yourself up a cheering song of how <END>
someones road home from work this once was <END>
who may be just ahead of you on foot <END>
or creaking with a buggy load of grain <END>
the height of the adventure is the height <END>
of country where two village cultures faded <END>
into each other both of them are lost <END>
and if youre lost enough to find yourself <END>
by now pull in your ladder road behind you <END>
and put a sign up closed to all but me <END>
then make yourself at home the only field <END>
now lefts no bigger than a harness gall <END>
first theres the childrens house of makebelieve <END>
some shattered dishes underneath a pine <END>
the playthings in the playhouse of the children <END>
weep for what little things could make them glad <END>
then for the house that is no more a house <END>
but only a belilaced cellar hole <END>
now slowly closing like a dent in dough <END>
this was no playhouse but a house in earnest <END>
your destination and your destinys <END>
a brook that was the water of the house <END>
cold as a spring as yet so near its source <END>
too lofty and original to rage <END>
we know the valley streams that when aroused <END>
will leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn <END>
i have kept hidden in the instep arch <END>
of an old cedar at the waterside <END>
a broken drinking goblet like the grail <END>
under a spell so the wrong ones cant find it <END>
so cant get saved as saint mark says they mustnt <END>
i stole the goblet from the childrens playhouse <END>
here are your waters and your watering place <END>
drink and be whole again beyond confusion <END>
i walked down alone sunday after church <END>
to the place where john has been cutting trees <END>
to see for myself about the birch <END>
he said i could have to bush my peas <END>
the sun in the newcut narrow gap <END>
was hot enough for the first of may <END>
and stifling hot with the odor of sap <END>
from stumps still bleeding their life away <END>
the frogs that were peeping a thousand shrill <END>
wherever the ground was low and wet <END>
the minute they heard my step went still <END>
to watch me and see what i came to get <END>
birch boughs enough piled everywhere‚êî <END>
all fresh and sound from the recent axe <END>
time someone came with cart and pair <END>
and got them off the wild flowers backs <END>
they might be good for garden things <END>
to curl a little finger round <END>
the same as you seize catscradle strings <END>
and lift themselves up off the ground <END>
small good to anything growing wild <END>
they were crooking many a trillium <END>
that had budded before the boughs were piled <END>
and since it was coming up had to come <END>
over back where they speak of life as staying <END>
you couldnt call it living for it aint <END>
there was an old old house renewed with paint <END>
and in it a piano loudly playing <END>
out in the plowed ground in the cold a digger <END>
among unearthed potatoes standing still <END>
was counting winter dinners one a hill <END>
with half an ear to the pianos vigor <END>
all that piano and new paint back there <END>
was it some money suddenly come into <END>
or some extravagance young love had been to <END>
or old love on an impulse not to care <END>
not to sink under being man and wife <END>
but get some color and music out of life <END>
it was long i lay <END>
awake that night <END>
wishing that night <END>
would name the hour <END>
and tell me whether <END>
to call it day <END>
though not yet light <END>
and give up sleep <END>
the snow fell deep <END>
with the hiss of spray <END>
two winds would meet <END>
one down one street <END>
one down another <END>
and fight in a smother <END>
of dust and feather <END>
i could not say <END>
but feared the cold <END>
had checked the pace <END>
of the tower clock <END>
by tying together <END>
its hands of gold <END>
before its face <END>
then cane one knock <END>
a note unruffled <END>
of earthly weather <END>
though strange and muffled <END>
the tower said one <END>
and then a steeple <END>
they spoke to themselves <END>
and such few people <END>
as winds might rouse <END>
from sleeping warm <END>
but not unhouse <END>
they left the storm <END>
that struck en masse <END>
my window glass <END>
like a beaded fur <END>
in that grave one <END>
they spoke of the sun <END>
and moon and stars <END>
saturn and mars <END>
and jupiter <END>
still more unfettered <END>
they left the named <END>
and spoke of the lettered <END>
the sigmas and taus <END>
of constellations <END>
they filled their throats <END>
with the furthest bodies <END>
to which man sends his <END>
speculation <END>
beyond which god is <END>
the cosmic motes <END>
of yawning lenses <END>
their solemn peals <END>
were not their own <END>
they spoke for the clock <END>
with whose vast wheels <END>
theirs interlock <END>
in that grave word <END>
uttered alone <END>
the utmost star <END>
trembled and stirred <END>
though set so far <END>
its whirling frenzies <END>
appear like standing <END>
in one self station <END>
it has not ranged <END>
and save for the wonder <END>
of once expanding <END>
to be a nova <END>
it has not changed <END>
to the eye of man <END>
on planets over <END>
around and under <END>
it in creation <END>
since man began <END>
to drag down man <END>
and nation nation <END>
the surest thing there is is we are riders <END>
and though none too successful at it guiders <END>
through everything presented land and tide <END>
and now the very air of what we ride <END>
what is this talkedof mystery of birth <END>
but being mounted bareback on the earth <END>
we can just see the infant up astride <END>
his small fist buried in the bushy hide <END>
there is our wildest mount a headless horse <END>
but though it runs unbridled off its course <END>
and all our blandishments would seem defied <END>
we have ideas yet that we havent tried <END>
i let myself in at the kitchen door <END>
its you she said i cant get up forgive me <END>
not answering your knock i can no more <END>
let people in than i can keep them out <END>
im getting too old for my size i tell them <END>
my fingers are about all ive the use of <END>
sos to take any comfort i can sew <END>
i help out with this beadwork what i can <END>
thats a smart pair of pumps youre beading there <END>
who are they for <END>
you mean oh for some miss <END>
i cant keep track of other peoples daughters <END>
lord if i were to dream of everyone <END>
whose shoes i primped to dance in <END>
and wheres john <END>
havent you seen him strange what set you off <END>
to come to his house when hes gone to yours <END>
you cant have passed each other i know what <END>
he must have changed his mind and gone to garlands <END>
he wont be long in that case you can wait <END>
though what good you can be or anyone <END>
its gone so far youve heard estelles run off <END>
yes whats it all about when did she go <END>
two weeks since <END>
shes in earnest it appears <END>
im sure she wont come back shes hiding somewhere <END>
i dont know where myself john thinks i do <END>
he thinks i only have to say the word <END>
and shell come back but bless you im her mother <END>
i cant talk to her and lord if i could <END>
it will go hard with john what will he do <END>
he cant find anyone to take her place <END>
oh if you ask me that what will he do <END>
he gets some sort of bakeshop meals together <END>
with me to sit and tell him everything <END>
whats wanted and how much and where it is <END>
but when im gone of course i cant stay here <END>
estelles to take me when shes settled down <END>
he and i only hinder one another <END>
i tell them they cant get me through the door though <END>
ive been built in here like a big church organ <END>
weve been here fifteen years <END>
thats a long time <END>
to live together and then pull apart <END>
how do you see him living when youre gone <END>
two of you out will leave an empty house <END>
i dont just see him living many years <END>
left here with nothing but the furniture <END>
i hate to think of the old place when were gone <END>
with the brook going by below the yard <END>
and no one here but hens blowing about <END>
if he could sell the place but then he cant <END>
no one will ever live on it again <END>
its too run down this is the last of it <END>
what i think he will do is let things smash <END>
hell sort of swear the time away hes awful <END>
i never saw a man let family troubles <END>
make so much difference in his mans affairs <END>
hes just dropped everything hes like a child <END>
i blame his being brought up by his mother <END>
hes got hay down thats been rained on three times <END>
he hoed a little yesterday for me <END>
i thought the growing things would do him good <END>
something went wrong i saw him throw the hoe <END>
skyhigh with both hands i can see it now <END>
come here ill show you in that apple tree <END>
thats no way for a man to do at his age <END>
hes fiftyfive you know if hes a day <END>
arent you afraid of him whats that gun for <END>
oh thats been there for hawks since chickentime <END>
john hall touch me not if he knows his friends <END>
ill say that for him johns no threatener <END>
like some men folk no ones afraid of him <END>
all is hes made up his mind not to stand <END>
what he has got to stand <END>
where is estelle <END>
couldnt one talk to her what does she say <END>
you say you dont know where she is <END>
nor want to <END>
she thinks if it was bad to live with him <END>
it must be right to leave him <END>
which is wrong <END>
yes but he should have married her <END>
i know <END>
the strains been too much for her all these years <END>
i cant explain it any other way <END>
its different with a man at least with john <END>
he knows hes kinder than the run of men <END>
better than married ought to be as good <END>
as married thats what he has always said <END>
i know the way hes felt but all the same <END>
i wonder why he doesnt marry her <END>
and end it <END>
too late now she wouldnt have him <END>
hes given her time to think of something else <END>
thats his mistake the dear knows my interest <END>
has been to keep the thing from breaking up <END>
this is a good home i dont ask for better <END>
but when ive said why shouldnt they be married <END>
hed say why should they no more words than that <END>
and after all why should they johns been fair <END>
i take it what was his was always hers <END>
there was no quarrel about property <END>
reason enough there was no property <END>
a friend or two as good as own the farm <END>
such as it is it isnt worth the mortgage <END>
i mean estelle has always held the purse <END>
the rights of that are harder to get at <END>
i guess estelle and i have filled the purse <END>
twas we let him have money not he us <END>
johns a bad farmer im not blaming him <END>
take it year in year out he doesnt make much <END>
we came here for a home for me you know <END>
estelle to do the housework for the board <END>
of both of us but look how it turns out <END>
she seems to have the housework and besides <END>
half of the outdoor work though as for that <END>
hed say she does it more because she likes it <END>
you see our pretty things are all outdoors <END>
our hens and cows and pigs are always better <END>
than folks like us have any business with <END>
farmers around twice as well off as we <END>
havent as good they dont go with the farm <END>
one thing you cant help liking about john <END>
hes fond of nice things too fond some would say <END>
but estelle dont complain shes like him there <END>
she wants our hens to be the best there are <END>
you never saw this room before a show <END>
full of lank shivery halfdrowned birds <END>
in separate coops having their plumage done <END>
the smell of the wet feathers in the heat <END>
you spoke of johns not being safe to stay with <END>
you dont know what a gentle lot we are <END>
we wouldnt hurt a hen you ought to see us <END>
moving a flock of hens from place to place <END>
were not allowed to take them upside down <END>
all we can hold together by the legs <END>
two at a times the rule one on each arm <END>
no matter how far and how many times <END>
we have to go <END>
you mean thats johns idea <END>
and we live up to it or i dont know <END>
what childishness he wouldnt give way to <END>
he manages to keep the upper hand <END>
on his own farm hes boss but as to hens <END>
we fence our flowers in and the hens range <END>
nothings too good for them we say it pays <END>
john likes to tell the offers he has had <END>
twenty for this cock twentyfive for that <END>
he never takes the money if theyre worth <END>
that much to sell theyre worth as much to keep <END>
bless you its all expense though reach me down <END>
the little tin box on the cupboard shelf <END>

hes been in a glass case as you may say <END>
the crystal palace london hes imported <END>
john bought him and we paid the bill with beads <END>
wampum i call it mind we dont complain <END>
but you see dont you we take care of him <END>
and like it too it makes it all the worse <END>
it seems as if and thats not all hes helpless <END>
in ways that i can hardly tell you of <END>
sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts <END>
to see where all the money goes so fast <END>
you know how men will be ridiculous <END>
but its just fun the way he gets bedeviled <END>
if hes untidy now what will he be   <END>
it makes it all the worse you must be blind <END>
estelles the one you neednt talk to me <END>
cant you and i get to the root of it <END>
whats the real trouble what will satisfy her <END>
its as i say shes turned from him thats all <END>
but why when shes well off is it the neighbours <END>
being cut off from friends <END>
we have our friends <END>
that isnt it folks arent afraid of us <END>
shes let it worry her you stood the strain <END>
and youre her mother <END>

she raised her voice against the closing door <END>
who wants to hear your news you dreadful fool <END>
a winter garden in an alder swamp <END>
where conies now come out to sun and romp <END>
as near a paradise as it can be <END>
and not melt snow or start a dormant tree <END>
it lifts existence on a plane of snow <END>
one level higher than the earth below <END>
one level nearer heaven overhead <END>
and last years berries shining scarlet red <END>
it lifts a gaunt luxuriating beast <END>
where he can stretch and hold his highest feat <END>
on some wild apple trees young tender bark <END>
what well may prove the years high girdle mark <END>
so near to paradise all pairing ends <END>
here loveless birds now flock as winter friends <END>
content with budinspecting they presume <END>
to say which buds are leaf and which are bloom <END>
a featherhammer gives a double knock <END>
this eden day is done at two oclock <END>
an hour of winter day might seem too short <END>
to make it worth lifes while to wake and sport <END>
